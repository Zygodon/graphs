# Kill local pairings

# Attempt to visualise the importance
# of specifically quadrat level association by reconstructing assembly
# level associations by simulation where the quadrat level association
# is destroyed. 
# In this case, if quadrat level were unimportant, the
# simuation would not affect the reconstructed assembly level odds ratios,
# so the graph of simulated assembly OR vs observed assembly OR would
# have the points on or near the unit slope.
# Conversely, if assembly level associations were unimportant (so, only
# quadrat associations contribute to the odds ratios), the points on the graph 
# would lie on a horizontal line crossing the origin. The result is near
# the second of these two scenarios, demonstrating the importance of 
# associations between plants in the same quadrat, not just in the 
# same assembly.

# The second plot checks that the simulation has in fact recovered the 
# observed assembly level odds ratios, while destroying any extra 
# association at the quadrat level.

# NOTE: Log odds ratio used throughout. i.e. for "odds ratio" everywhere, read
# "log(odds_ratio)".
