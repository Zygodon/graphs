# Objectives of the study.
As part of [The River Ouse Project](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/riverouse/), we have been collecting survey data from species rich meadows since 2006. The primary objective of this survey has been to assess candidate sites for their potential for biodiversity improvement and/or flood prevention, and in the first instance the data have been used by the survey team to assess the sites using the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) scheme. The  primary output of the project has been a series of reports useful to stakeholders (landowners, statutory bodies and local bodies such as the Sussex Wildlife Trust). 

My contribution has been to clean the data for storage in a relational database, which it is our intention to publish (e.g. on the Zenodo site). At the same time, I have taken an interest in the statistical value of the considerable body of data produced over the years. 

This study, reported here,  departs from the primary use of the data in that I am not concerned with the NVC status of the sites. Instead, I am looking for two things: evidence for inter-specific associations between plant taxa (with a view to understanding their ecological significance by considering known environmental preferences), and, more tentatively, evidence for scale-related effects on strength of association.

# A brief description of the data.
As I write, the meadows database is up to date with the 2019 survey data. We have collected data from 260 stands assemblies considered a priori by the survey team to be more or less uniform stands from an NVC viewpoint. The composition of the data set according to the NVC scores assigned by the team are shown in Figure 1; I stress that this is by no means a random selection of mesotrophic grassland sites in the Ouse catchment. All the sites are located beside streams, and have been selected for their potential according to the criteria set out above.

The survey team record abundance data (DOMIN estimates) in 2m x 2m or 4m x 4m qyadrats with at least 5 quadrats per stand, which I reduce to presence/absence data for the purposes of this study. *My database extract pulls in only data from 2m x 2m quadrats, and only from stands that were surveyed with 5 quadrats; 540 quadrats, 108 stands*.

# Species composition of the data extract.
My data contains records of 206 plant taxa. I intend a pairwise co-occurrence analysis, which would be 42230 pairs, which would get us into microarray assay like quantities of data. Fortunately, most of them occur infrequently (Figure 2), so it seems sensible to reduce the list to species which occur at least 20 times (a purely arbitrary cut off), leaving 68 species, 4556 pairs.

# Evidence for interspecific associations.
My approach has been to treat measuring the stength of any associations and assessing their "significance" as two separate problems. Given a pair of species, I make a 2 x 2 contingency table with cells abcd labelled in the usual way - a the cell with both species present, d with neither, etc. I chose to measure association strength by the (logarithm of) the odds ratio (LOR), ad/bc, a quantity which we expect to be normally distributed with 0 implying no association, positive values implying positive association, and negative values implying negative association (exclusion). For this study I used Pearson's chi squared test with p<0.05 to assess the significance of the association. Pearson's chi squared test is specifically designed to reveal the presence of association so it seems sensible to use it for this purpose; but it does not reveal the direction of the effect, for which log(odds ratio) therefore seems better suited. At this point, I am not particularly concerned with the ecological meaning, if any, of the odds ratio, other than as a measure of the strength of an association. I believe it will be easier to interpret the ecological significance of the findings when we know exactly which species are involved.

Figure 2a shows the distribution of LOR from contingency tables constructed on the presence/absence of pairs of species recorded from *stands* - i.e. sampled over five quadrats. 
![Figure 2](C:/R/Git/graphs/LOR histograms.png)
The mean, 0.511, suggests that there are more examples of association than exclusion in the data. The histogram and its fitted normal distribution together suggest that the LOR is neither under-dispersed nor over dispersed; i.e. no long tails suggesting just a few exclusions/associations in an otherwise largely null data set. It appears we are not looking for needles in haystacks here and can conclude that positive interspecific association is common in our data.

Figure 2b shows the effect of removing pairs on the basis of the chi square criterion. This leaves 133 pairs representing 68 species, which we can think of as potentially interesting pairs. In a sense, the analysis so far has achieved a primary objective, namely, which species will be interesting for further investigation.

I note in passing that chisq.test in R issued several warnings; unsurprisingly some of the cells in the contingency tables have low counts. I'm accepting this for the moment as a preliminary exploration of the data (unfashionably frequentist, I know, but hey, it's convenient, isn't it?); in future I will use Fisher's exact test which will have the added advantage of returning a Maximum Likelihood estimate of the odds ratio. I assume this is superior to the simple sample estimate, and also will simplify the code.
